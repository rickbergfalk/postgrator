# Postgrator 3

A Node.js SQL migration library using a directory of plain SQL scripts. Supports
Postgres, MySQL, and SQL Server.

Available as a cli tool: https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgrator-cli.

## Installation

```sh
npm install postgrator
# install necessary db engine(s) if not installed yet
npm install pg@7      # pg@6 supported as of postgrator 3.2.0
npm install mysql@2
npm install mssql@4
```

## Supported DB Drivers

Using a package version other than the below may not work.

* pg 6.x.x
* pg 7.x.x
* mysql 2.x.x
* mssql 4.x.x

## Version 3.0 breaking changes

The API has completely changed with Postgrator 3, but does not bring any changes
to the migration format. See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Usage

Create a directory and stick some SQL scripts in there that change your database
in some way. It might look like:

```
migrations/
  |- 001.do.sql
  |- 001.undo.sql
  |- 002.do.optional-description-of-script.sql
  |- 002.undo.optional-description-of-script.sql
  |- 003.do.sql
  |- 003.undo.sql
  |- 004.do.js
  |- 004.undo.js
  |- ... and so on
```

The files must follow the convention
[version].[action].[optional-description].sql or
[version].[action].[optional-description].js

**Version** must be a number, but you may start and increment the numbers in any
way you'd like. If you choose to use a purely sequential numbering scheme
instead of something based off a timestamp, you will find it helpful to start
with 000s or some large number for file organization purposes.

**Action** must be either "do" or "undo". Do implements the version, and undo
undoes it.

**Optional-description** can be a label or tag to help keep track of what
happens inside the script. Descriptions should not contain periods.

**SQL or JS** You have a choice of either using a plain SQL file or you can also
generate your SQL via a javascript module. The javascript module should export a
function called generateSql() that returns back a string representing the SQL.
For example:

```js
module.exports.generateSql = function() {
  return (
    "CREATE USER transaction_user WITH PASSWORD '" +
    process.env.TRANSACTION_USER_PASSWORD +
    "'"
  )
}
```

You might want to choose the JS file approach, in order to make use (secret)
environment variables such as the above.

To run your sql migrations with Postgrator, write a Node.js script or integrate
postgrator with your application.

When first run against your database, Postgrator will create the table specified
by config.schemaTable. Postgrator relies on this table to track what version the
database is at.

Postgrator automatically determines whether it needs to go "up" or "down", and
will update the schemaTable accordingly. If the database is already at the
version specified to migrate to, Postgrator does nothing. After running
migrations, postgrator will close its connection created.

```js
const Postgrator = require('postgrator')

const postgrator = new Postgrator({
  // Directory containing migration files
  migrationDirectory: __dirname + '/migrations',
  // or a glob pattern to files
  migrationPattern: __dirname + '/some/pattern/*',
  // Driver: must be pg, mysql, or mssql
  driver: 'pg',
  // Database connection config
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 5432,
  database: 'databasename',
  username: 'username',
  password: 'password',
  // Schema table name. Optional. Default is schemaversion
  schemaTable: 'schemaversion'
})

// Migrate to specific version
postgrator
  .migrate('002')
  .then(appliedMigrations => console.log(appliedMigrations))
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error)
    // Because migrations prior to the migration with error would have run
    // error object is decorated with appliedMigrations
    console.log(error.appliedMigrations) // array of migration objects
  })

// Migrate to max version (optionally can provide 'max')
postgrator
  .migrate()
  .then(appliedMigrations => console.log(appliedMigrations))
  .catch(error => console.log(error))
```

### Postgres options:

Postgres supports connection string url as well as simple ssl config:

```js
const postgrator = new Postgrator({
  connectionString: 'tcp://username:password@hosturl/databasename',
  ssl: true
})
```

### SQL Server options:

For SQL Server, you may optionally provide an additional options configuration.
This may be necessary if requiring a secure connection for Azure.

```js
const postgrator = new Postgrator({
  requestTimeout: 1000 * 60 * 60, // Default 1 hour
  connectionTimeout: 30000 // override mssql 15 second default
  options: {
    encrypt: true
  }
})
```

Reference options for mssql for more details:
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/mssql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mssql)

### Checksum validation

By default Postgrator will generate an md5 checksum for each migration file, and
save the value to the schema table after a successful migration.

Prior to applying migrations to a database, for any existing migration in the
migration directory already run Postgrator will validate the md5 checksum to
ensure the contents of the script have not changed. If a change is detected,
migration will stop reporting an error.

Because line endings may differ between environments/editors, an option is
available to force a specific line ending prior to generating the checksum.

```js
const postgrator = new Postgrator({
  validateChecksums: true, // Set to false to skip validation
  newline: 'CRLF' // Force using 'CRLF' (windows) or 'LF' (unix/mac)
})
```

### Migration object

Postgrator will often return a migration object or array of migrations. The
format of a migration object is

```js
{
  version: versionNumber,
  action: 'do',
  name: 'first-table',
  filename: '0001.up.first-table.sql',
  md5: 'checksumvalue',
  getSql: () => {} // sync function to get sql from file
}
```

### Logging

As of v3 nothing is logged to the console, and the option to toggle that has
been removed. Instead postgrator is an event emiter, allowing you to log however
you want to log. There are no events for error or finish

```js
const postgrator = new Postgrator(options)
postgrator.on('validation-started', migration => console.log(migration))
postgrator.on('validation-finished', migration => console.log(migration))
postgrator.on('migration-started', migration => console.log(migration))
postgrator.on('migration-finished', migration => console.log(migration))
```

### Migration errors

If `postgrator.migrate()` fails running multiple migrations, Postgrator will
stop running any further migrations. Migrations successfully run prior to the
migration with the error will remain implemented however.

If you need to migration back down to the version the database was at prior to
running migrate(), that is up to you to implement. Instead of doing this
however, consider writing your application in a way that is compatible with any
version of a future release.

In the event of an error during migration, the error object will be decorated
with an array of migrations that run successfully (`error.appliedMIgrations`).

Keep in mind how you write your SQL - You may (or may not) want to write your
SQL defensively (ie, check for pre-existing objects before you create new ones).

### Preventing partial migrations

Depending on your database and database configuration, consider wrapping each
migration in a transaction or BEGIN/END block. By default Postgres and SQL
Server consider multiple statements run in one execution part of one implicit
transaction. MySQL however will implement up to the failure.

If using SQL Server, do not write a migration containing multiple statements
using the `GO` keyword. Instead break statements between the `GO` keyword into
multiple migration files, ensuring that you do not end up with partial
migrations implemented but no record of that happening.

### Utility methods

Some of postgrator's methods may come in useful performing other migration tasks

```js
// To get max version available from filesystem
// version returned as number, not string
postgrator
  .getMaxVersion()
  .then(version => console.log(version))
  .catch(error => console.error(error))

// "current" database schema version
// version returned as number, not string
postgrator
  .getDatabaseVersion()
  .then(version => console.log(version))
  .catch(error => console.error(error))

// To get all migrations from directory and parse metadata
postgrator
  .getMigrations()
  .then(migrations => console.log(migrations))
  .catch(error => console.error(error))

// Run arbitrary SQL query against database
// Connection is established, query is run, then connection is ended
// `results.rows` will be an array of row objects, with column names as keys
// `results` object may have other properties depending on db driver
postgrator
  .runQuery('SELECT * FROM sometable')
  .then(results => console.log(results))
  .catch(error => console.error(error))
```

## Tests

A docker-compose file is provided with postgres and mysql (mariadb) containers
configured for the tests. SQL Server tests also exist, but are commented out
since the requirements are quite high to run them.

To run postgrator tests locally, you'll need Docker installed.

```sh
# In one terminal window
docker-compose up
# In another terminal once databases are up
npm test
# After tests, in docker session
# control/command-c to quit docker-compose and remove containers
docker-compose rm --force
```
